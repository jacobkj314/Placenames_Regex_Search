To start, download and extract the dataset (planet-latest_geonames.tsv) at https://github.com/OSMNames/OSMNames/releases/download/v2.0.4/planet-latest_geonames.tsv.gz to this directory.
Then run extract.py.

Now you are all set up and you can run search.py!
To search, simply enter a regular expression (without quotes needed) -- see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp for a helpful guide to regular expressions if needed.
Optionally place a tab followed by a two-letter country code to narrow results down to a specific country.
